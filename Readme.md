# Zachary Ryan – Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site, built to introduce who I am, what I’ve worked on, and where I’m headed in cybersecurity.

## About the Website

The site is a single-page portfolio with these sections:

- **About Me** – Brief background on my service in the U.S. Navy and my transition into cybersecurity at Robert Morris University.
- **Education** – Highlight of my B.S. in Cybersecurity at RMU.
- **Skills** – Technical and professional skills, each represented with an icon and label.
- **Experience** – Navy reactor department role and work at Sewickley BMW / Audi / Porsche.
- **Projects** – A few security-focused and programming projects with links to their GitHub repos.
- **Achievements** – Academic honors, certifications, and club involvement.
- **Contact** – Quick links to reach me via LinkedIn, GitHub, and email.

## Tech Stack

The site is intentionally simple and lightweight:

- **HTML** – Structure and content.
- **CSS** – Layout, colors, typography, responsive design, and hover effects.
- **Google Fonts** – For headings and body text.
- **Devicon + Custom Icons** – Technology and skill icons via CDN and assets in the project.

There is currently **no JavaScript**; all interactivity (like the skill icon hover effect) is done with CSS.

## Features

- **Responsive layout** that works on desktop and mobile.
- **Fixed navigation bar** with smooth scrolling to each section.
- **Hover effects on skill icons** using CSS transforms.
- **Project cards** with consistent layout and GitHub links:
  - Port Scanner
  - Password Cracker
  - Personal Portfolio Website (this site)
- **Education and Experience highlights** that connect my Navy background to cybersecurity.
- **Contact section** with clickable icons for LinkedIn, GitHub, and email.

Future Improvements

Some ideas I may add later:

Subtle animations (e.g., section fade-ins or button transitions).

A simple contact form.

Additional security labs or write-ups in the Projects section.

Accessibility improvements and further performance tuning.
